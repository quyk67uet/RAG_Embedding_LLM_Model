# RAG with Hugging Face, Gemma, and MongoDB

This repository contains a project that implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Hugging Face**, **Gemma**, and **MongoDB**. The goal of this project is to generate responses to user queries by embedding movie content into vectors and using these vectors to retrieve relevant content. A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is then employed to generate a coherent response based on the retrieved content.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Movie Content Embedding**: 
    - Each movie's content is processed and converted into vector representations using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the content and are stored in a database for efficient retrieval.

2. **Vector Storage and Retrieval**:
    - The vector embeddings are stored in a **MongoDB** database, which allows for efficient querying and retrieval of relevant content based on user queries. Gemma is used to facilitate this process by providing tools for vector search.

3. **Query Processing and Response Generation**:
    - When a user inputs a query, the system first converts the query into a vector using the same embedding model. This vector is then used to search for the most relevant movie content in the MongoDB database.
    - After retrieving the relevant content, a **Large Language Model (LLM)** is employed to generate a natural language response that integrates the retrieved content, providing a coherent and contextually appropriate answer to the user.

## Key Technologies

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Used for generating vector embeddings from movie content and user queries.
- **Gemma**: A tool for efficient vector search and retrieval, facilitating the matching of user queries with relevant content stored in MongoDB.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing vector embeddings and enabling fast retrieval based on similarity searches.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Utilized for generating human-like responses by synthesizing information from the retrieved content.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment**:
    - Install the necessary libraries and dependencies in your Colab environment by running the provided installation commands.
    
2. **Embedding Movie Content**:
    - Run the script to process the movie content and generate vector embeddings. These embeddings will be stored in MongoDB for later retrieval.

3. **Query and Response**:
    - Enter a user query to see the system retrieve the most relevant movie content and generate a response using the LLM.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a powerful approach to content retrieval and response generation by combining state-of-the-art machine learning models with efficient database querying. The integration of RAG with Hugging Face, Gemma, and MongoDB allows for flexible, scalable, and intelligent interaction with users based on a rich dataset of movie content.
